Welcome to Zach's Burger Shop.

In project0 I created a static webpage that simulates the process of ordering a hamburger online.

The customer is free to select specific items that they would like for their order, from bun type, to the composition of their patty (there is even a vegetarian option), as well as toppings like veggies and sauces.

Once the customer has selected all of their desired options, they can continue to the cart where they can review their order and submit their payment as well as delivery information. If the user submits their order, they are directed to a confirmation page where they can elect to create an account to store their payment and delivery information for faster order processing in the future. 

All of the pages are generated statically. There is no server-side computations carried out to validate the users input, process an order, or specifically generate a cart template with the users selected options.
