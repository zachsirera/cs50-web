# Project 1 - Books

This is my submission for CS50 - Web Programming with Python and Javascript.

This project is a book review websites that allows users to register an account in my application's database, 
log in, search for books based on a pre-loaded list of books, and log reviews for books they have read.

This tool will also use the goodreads API to extract the average score for a book as well as how many reviews it has. 

Libraries, modules, or APIs used to accomplish this are: os, requests, psycopg2, flask, werkzeug, and sqlalchemy.
